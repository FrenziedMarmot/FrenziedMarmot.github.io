    California Online Privacy Protection Act
</h3>
<p>
    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
    The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably
    the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to
    post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals
    with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at:

</p>

</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
    <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first

    COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
</h3>
<p>
    When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection
    Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces
    the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's
    privacy and safety online.
</p>
<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
